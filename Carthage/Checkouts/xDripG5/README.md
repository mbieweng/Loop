A iOS framework providing an interface for communicating with the G5 glucose transmitter over Bluetooth. The name and inspiration comes from [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/), a breakthrough application for connecting to the G4 system.

*Please note this project is neither created nor backed by Dexcom, Inc. This software is not intended for use in therapy.*

## Requirements

This framework connects to a G5 Mobile Transmitter via Bluetooth LE. It does not connect to the G4 Share Receiver or any earlier CGM products.

## Installation

### Carthage

xDripG5 is available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install it, add the following line to your Cartfile:

```ruby
github "LoopKit/xDripG5"
```

Note that you'll need to confgure your target to link against `CommonCrypto.framework` in addition to `xDripG5.framework`

### CocoaPods

xDripG5 is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "xDripG5"
```

## Usage

The quickest way to run the example project is via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Run `pod try xDripG5` in the terminal. 
Since Bluetooth LE is required, you will need to build and run on a real device.

If you plan to run your app alongside the G5 Mobile application, make sure to set `passiveModeEnabled` to true.
